# Programming Ideas Solutions

## About

This project aims to give variuos solution to the programming ideas. The ideas are taken from [Programming ideas 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alansa.ideabag2&hl=en) app on the playstore. 

We aim at finding solutions to the questions using different programming languages and improve on them. 

## Methodology

The solutions in time will cover various programming languages as well as programming paradigms.

Often there are several approaches to solving any problem. There might not be a best way but there may be several optimum ways depending on the context. Sometimes clarity is required more than slight improvements in effeciency.

Keeping all this mind, this project aims to consolidate the various solution under one banner and to clearly highlight the pros and cons of each approach.

Contributors are encouraged to add solutions that may be more optimum or are simpler. You can also add more languages and paradigms if you feel those give a better dimension to the solutions presented here.

## Current Work

At the moment I am working on bringing forward solutions in C++. The reason for choosing C++ is that its a multiple paradigm language. Its also fast and allows for the coder to write code with different levels of abstraction and verbosity. In time I intend to add more languages and more paradigms in the same language.

I also intend to add multiple versions of the same program, ranging from a naive approach to more optimized ones and situation dependent versions.
